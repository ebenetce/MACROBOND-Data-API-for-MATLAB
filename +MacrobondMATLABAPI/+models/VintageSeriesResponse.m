% VintageSeriesResponse Properties:
%   errorText - The error text if there was an error or not specified if there was no error - type: string
%   errorCode - Set if there was an error and not specified if there was no error  206 = PartialContent (The operation was successful, but only new revisions are included)  304 = NotModified (The item was not modified and is not included in the response)  403 = Forbidden (Access to the item was denied)  404 = NotFound (The item was not found)  500 = Other (There was an error and it is described in the error text) - type: ResponseErrorCode
%   metadata - The metadata of the entity or not specified if there was an error - type: MacrobondMATLABAPI.JSONMapperMap
%   values - The values of the series or not specified if there was an error. Missing values are represented by null. - type: array of double
%   dates - The dates of the series or not specified if there was an error - type: array of datetime
%   timesOfChange - The time each value was last modified - type: array of datetime
