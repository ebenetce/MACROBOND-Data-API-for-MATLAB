## MACROBOND Data API for MATLAB

This repository autogenerates the Macrobond Data API for MATLAB. The latest openAPI definition is pulled once a month from the official directory:

https://api.macrobondfinancial.com/swagger/v1/swagger.json

which generates the MATLAB files into `/AutogeneratedAPI`. This is then manually ammended to add a few bits like the authentication and finally packaged as a toolbox (to-do)
